# Sucralose!
### A sweeter way to use e621.net.

This is a fresh rewrite of the original Sucralose.
You can visit the legacy version at https://metalloriff.github.io/sucralose-legacy/

## What is it?
Sucralose is a humble front-end replacement for https://e621.net, using their API/back-end.

The goal is to provide a smoother, more user-friendly and mobile-friendly experience,
along with a little extra customization.

## Why?
I've always found e621 to have an outdated and lacking UX.

Managing sets is a disaster, you have to visit posts to vote/favorite them, UI feels clunky, etc.

And also, I just enjoy making things, and e621 provides a pretty good and easy-to-understand API.
